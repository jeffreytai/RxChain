# RxChain

RxChain is designed to target the issues revolving around the pharmaceutical supply chain, including but not limited to inefficient distribution, cumbersome regulation, adverse event reporting, and counterfeit drugs. By placing all relevant data about prescriptions on the blockchain, transparent and up-to-date information is made available from end to end for every party involved.
